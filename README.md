# AlexaPacking

An Alexa app that keeps track of all of your belongings throughout the moving process. 
When packing simply tell Alexa you want to start a new box and give it a name. Then say "Add __ to __". 
When unpacking, ask Alexa where a certain item is and she will give you the name of the box you put it in.
